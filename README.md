I'm using this as a display and a 'backup' of all of my scripts I use on a daily basis for my work. A lot of what is here will make essentially no sense without seeing the sheets I am working off of.
Everything here was originally created in Google Apps Script for use through Google Sheets. Most sheet names and variable names have been changed for privacy.
If anyone sees something they might find useful they are welcome to take it and use it or if anyone has comments or suggestions then please feel free to comment what the changes would be. Please do not alter any of the code here
if that is something that people can do. I am completely unfamiliar with GitHub so I just want to get to know the system since I understand it is useful in the coding/IT/CS world in general.
